## Payment calculations

- [Back home](../readme.md)

Each action has a different way of calculating the total owed annually if the application gets approved and accepted. Most are a simple multiplication of the quantity of measurement applied for by the value. For example, for **SCR1**, the calculation is `Â£588 per hectare (ha) per year`.
