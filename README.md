# Land Grants API

To read more about the farming grants platform, see this docs repo:

https://github.com/DEFRA/farming-grants-docs

The capabilities of the land grants API include:

- [land based grant application eligibility checks](#eligibility-checks)
- [grant payment calculations](#payment-calculations)
- [available area calculation](#available-area-calculation)

### Eligibility checks

When an applicant applies for an action to undertake on a land parcel (field), we need to determine their eligibility based on the data we have available. An example of eligibility criteria for the **SCR1: Create scrub and open habitat mosaics** action can be found in [this document](https://www.gov.uk/find-funding-for-land-or-farms/scr1-create-scrub-and-open-habitat-mosaics). This document contains this statement:

| Protected land                               | Eligibility                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) | Ineligible - you must not enter any area that's designated as an SSSI into this action |

In this case, the API will need to check if there is an intersection between the land parcel and the SSSI map layer and reject the application if so.

### Available Area Calculation

The purpose of the Available Area Calculation (AAC) is to work out the number of hectares of a land parcel someone is able to apply a particular action on. Say an applicant has a 3 hectare land parcel, has already agreed to do action **A** on 1 hectare of the parcel, is applying for action **B** and **A** and **B** aren't compatible with each other, the AAC should return 2 hectares.

Some more AAC scenarios are detailed here:

### Payment calculations

Each action has a different way of calculating the total owed annually if the application gets approved and accepted. Most are a simple multiplication of the quantity of measurement applied for by the value. For example, for **SCR1**, the calculation is `Â£588 per hectare (ha) per year`.

## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd land-grants-api
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Development helpers

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `/src/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.
