# Land Grants API

To read more about the farming grants platform, see this docs repo:

https://github.com/DEFRA/farming-grants-docs

The capabilities of the land grants API include:

- [land based grant application eligibility checks](#eligibility-checks)
- [grant payment calculations](#payment-calculations)
- [available area calculation](#available-area-calculation)

### Eligibility checks

When an applicant applies for an action to undertake on a land parcel (field), we need to determine their eligibility based on the data we have available. An example of eligibility criteria for the **SCR1: Create scrub and open habitat mosaics** action can be found in [this document](https://www.gov.uk/find-funding-for-land-or-farms/scr1-create-scrub-and-open-habitat-mosaics). This document contains this statement:

| Protected land                               | Eligibility                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) | Ineligible - you must not enter any area that's designated as an SSSI into this action |

In this case, the API will need to check if there is an intersection between the land parcel and the SSSI map layer and reject the application if so.

### Available Area Calculation

The purpose of the Available Area Calculation (AAC) is to work out the number of hectares of a land parcel someone is able to apply a particular action on. Say an applicant has a 3 hectare land parcel, has already agreed to do action **A** on 1 hectare of the parcel, is applying for action **B** and **A** and **B** aren't compatible with each other, the AAC should return 2 hectares.

Some more AAC scenarios are detailed here:

![Available Area Calculation Scenarios](aac-scenarios.png)

### Payment calculations

Each action has a different way of calculating the total owed annually if the application gets approved and accepted. Most are a simple multiplication of the quantity of measurement applied for by the value. For example, for **SCR1**, the calculation is `Â£588 per hectare (ha) per year`.

## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd land-grants-api
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Configuration

This API requires a `.env` file to operate, please view the `.env.example` for details of the required properties, talk to a collegue for missing values.

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Loading land-data into local postgres:

1. Copy files from https://defra.sharepoint.com/teams/Team1645/Restricted_FCP%20RPS%20Future/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FTeam1645%2FRestricted%5FFCP%20RPS%20Future%2Fland%2Dgrant%2Dapi%2Ddata&viewid=f5678bbd%2Dae3a%2D4cd4%2D9f4c%2Dab8e79452a94&ovuser=770a2450%2D0227%2D4c62%2D90c7%2D4e38537f1102%2CJilly%2EGledhill%40defra%2Egov%2Euk&OR=Teams%2DHL&CT=1733739622621&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNDEwMjAwMTMxOCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D

to srr/api/common/migration folder

2. set environment variables:

- DISABLE_POSTGRES=false
- NODE_ENV=local

Refer: .env.example
If you have issue with .env file set env variables in package.json scripts

```
 "dev": "NODE_ENV=local SEED_DB=true DISABLE_POSTGRES=false npm run server:watch",
```

3. run

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Successful data load message in the console on start-up

- Successfully loaded postgres data 001-create-schema.sql into Postgis
- Successfully loaded postgres data 002-create-land-table.sql into Postgis
- Successfully loaded postgres data 003-create-land-covers-table.sql into Postgis
- Successfully loaded postgres data 004-create-moorland-designations-table.sql into Postgis
- Successfully loaded postgres data land-parcels-data.sql into Postgis
- Successfully loaded postgres data land-covers-data.sql into Postgis

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)

## Development helpers

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `/src/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.
