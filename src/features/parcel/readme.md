# Parcel

## Why zero-availability actions are still reported

`getActionsWithAvailability` returns every displayed action, including ones
whose available area or length has fallen to zero. It must not omit them.

The acceptance criterion — _given a land parcel has no available building area, do
not display the building-related action as an option for that parcel_ — is satisfied
by grants-ui, not here. Its `hasAvailableLand` / `isVisibleOnInitialLoad` filtering
applies to any action in any unit, but it only sees the current figure while this
endpoint keeps reporting the action.

`mergeRecomputedAvailability` in grants-ui overwrites an action's availability only
when it finds a matching code in this response. Omitting a now-zero action would
therefore leave its stale, previously-fetched availability in place rather than
updating it to zero — the action would still be shown, with the old figure.
